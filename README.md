# Measuring-Temperature-with-the-LM35-sensor
## INTRODUCTION
Here is the project of measuring Temperature with the LM35 sensor. The project's system was designed by connecting the LM35 sensor with the analog signal processing, communication (transmitter and receiver), analog to digital converter circuits and Arduino.
Besides, the project was to design a physcial Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for transmitter including its power supply in order to read the analog signal of temperature. PCB was designed on PADS LOGIC for schematic and on PADS LAYOUT for layout.
